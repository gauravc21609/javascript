chapter 2:  number and maths
 
 order for operation:

multiply > divide > add > subtract

priority in operation :

multiply is greater then divide and add is more priotise than subtract.

if priority is same than it is calculated from left to right.

if we use () to control which part is dine first.

() hve the highest priority.

for calculating percentage, we must use decimal.

wired behavior of number

1) whole no is called integer. ig: 1, 2.

2) decimal no are float, ie .2, 5.2.
computer can only read binary no due which the float can have some issue in  calculating. so avoid decimal. calute in integer.

Round the number:

Math.round(2.2) = 2

Math.ceil(2.2) = 3

Math.floor(4.6) = 4
